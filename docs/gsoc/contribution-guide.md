# Getting Started with Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

## About the Program

### Welcome to Google Summer of Code

[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a 16 years old program, run every summer, with the intention of bringing more students into open source.

Open source projects apply as mentor organizations and if they are accepted, students send proposals to them to work on a few months' long project. Projects can be planned out by the organizations in advance or can be proposed by students.

Google pays the students, not the organizations they work with. Beginning in 2025, Google is opening the program up to all newcomers of open source that are 18 years and older.
