### What is YAML?

YAML stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language (a recursive acronym), but it originally stood for Yet Another Markup Language. It is a human-readable data serialization language that is often used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.

YAML is a superset of JSON, so JSON files are valid in YAML. However, YAML has a more human-readable syntax that makes it easier to read and write. YAML files use a .yml or .yaml extension, and follow specific syntax rules.

Here is an example of a YAML file:

```YAML
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  address:
    street: 123 Main Street
    city: Anytown
    state: CA
    zip: 12345
```

This YAML file defines a person with the name John Doe, who is 30 years old and lives at 123 Main Street in Anytown, CA. The address property is a nested object, which means that it contains another YAML object.

### Benefits of using YAML:

- **Human-readable syntax**: YAML files are easy to read and understand, even for people who are not familiar with the language.
- **Compact format**: YAML files can be very compact, which makes them easy to store and transmit.
- **Extensibility**: YAML is a very extensible language, which means that it can be customized to meet the specific needs of different applications.
- **Wide support**: YAML is supported by a wide variety of programming languages and tools.
