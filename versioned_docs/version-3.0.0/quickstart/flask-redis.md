### Get Started! üé¨

### Clone the application üß™

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-python.git && cd samples-python/flask-redis
```

## Using Docker Compose üê≥

We will be using Docker compose to run the application as well as Mongo on Docker container.

### Lights, Camera, Record! üé•

Capture the test-cases-

```shell
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --container-name "flask-web" --buildDelay 50
```

üî•**Make some API calls**. Postman, Hoppscotch or even curl - take your pick!

Let's make URLs short and sweet:

### Generate testcases

To generate testcases we just need to **make some API calls.**

1. **Make a POST request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/books/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"}'
```

2. **Make a GET request:**

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/books/?page=1&limit=10"
```

3. **Make a PUT request:**

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/books/1 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title": "1984 - Updated", "author": "George Orwell"}'
```

4. **Make a DELETE request:**

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/books/1
```

And once you are done, you can stop the recording and give yourself a pat on the back! With that simple spell, you've conjured up a test case with a mock! Explore the **keploy** directory and you'll discover your handiwork in `tests` directory and `mocks.yml`.

```yaml
version: api.keploy.io/v1beta1
kind: Redis

  redisrequests:

  redisresponses:
    - origin: server
      message:
        - type: string
          data: "+OK\r\n"

```

### **Time to run the testcases**

```bash
keploy test -c 'sudo docker compose up' --containerName "flask-web" --delay 10
```

You can also check the test summary from your cli

```bash
