## Running App Locally on Linux/WSL üêß

A simple sample CRUD application to test using Keploy build with Node, JWT and Postgres. Buckle up, it's gonna be a fun ride! üé¢

<InstallReminder />

### Setup application

Clone the repository and move to express-mongo folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript && cd samples-typescript/node-jwt

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

We'll be running our sample application right on Linux, but just to make things a tad more thrilling, we'll have the database (postgres) chill on Docker. Ready? Let's get the party started!üéâ

If you are using WSL on windows then use below to start wsl in the user's home directory:

```bash
wsl ~
```

### Let's start the Postgres Instance

```zsh
docker-compose up -d
```

## Capture the testcases

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy record -c 'node app.js'
```

### Let's Generate the testcases.

Make API Calls using Postman or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

1. Create User

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username":"user",
    "email":"user@keploy.io",
    "password":"1234"
}'
```

we will get the output:

```json
{"message": "User was registered successfully!"}
```

We will get the following output in our terminal

<img src="https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/keploy-jwt-capture.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Result Node JWT" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

Let's go ahead create few more testcases for different endpoints!

2. Create Admin User

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signup' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username":"admin",
    "email":"admin@keploy.io",
    "password":"1234",
    "role":["admin"]
}'
```

we will get the output:

```json
{"message": "User was registered successfully!"}
```

3. User Signin

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/auth/signin' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "username":"user",
    "email":"user@keploy.io",
    "password":"1234"
}'
```

We will get access token once the user has signed in:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "username": "user",
  "email": "user@keploy.io",
  "roles": ["ROLE_USER"],
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpZCI6MSwiaWF0IjoxNzEzNzY0ODY1LCJleHAiOjE3MTM3NjUwNDV9.5LSU1A1jxIbIQFS6Tq26ENNWZBinFt2cJQZ7swpipbc"
}
```

4. Access user Content

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/test/all'
```

We will get:

```
Public Content
```

5. Access user Content

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/test/user' \
--header 'x-access-token: <TOKEN>'
```

We will get

```
User Content
```

## Running the testcases

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy test -c 'npm run app.js' --delay 10
```

Our testcases will fail as the token would expire and new Token will generated again when we are using testmode. To make sure that testcases do not fail, we have use [timeFreezing](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-cloud/time-freezing/).

But for this application, the Token expiration is 10 mins so let's go ahead and test the application within 10 mins. Let's add the `Etag` and `accessToken` as the noise in the `keploy.yml` on line 21 under `globalNoise`. The file would look like:-

```
  globalNoise:
          global: {}
          test-sets:
            test-set-0:
              body:
                accessToken: []
              header:
                Etag: []
                Date: []
       
```

Now, let's run the keploy in test mode again:-

<img src="https://keploy-devrel.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/keploy-jwt-test-2.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Result Node JWT" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

But wait ‚Äî one test is still failing due to the time-freezing. To try out the time-freezing feature, you can use Keploy Enterprise.

### Wrapping it up üéâ

Congrats on the journey so far! You've seen Keploy's power, flexed your coding muscles, and had a bit of fun too! Now, go out there and keep exploring, innovating, and creating! Remember, with the right tools and a sprinkle of fun, anything's possible.üòäüöÄ

Happy coding! ‚ú®üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª‚ú®

## Using Docker Compose üê≥

A simple sample CRUD application to test using Keploy build with Node, JWT and Postgres. Buckle up, it's gonna be a fun ride! üé¢

<InstallReminder />

### Setup application

Clone the repository and move to express-mongo folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript && cd samples-typescript/node-jwt

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

We will be using Docker compose to run the application as well as Postgres on Docker container.

Since we have setup our sample-app using docker, we need to update the postgres host on line 2, in `config/db.config.js`, from `localhost` to `postgres`.

## Capture the testcases

We will run the keploy in record mode with docker-compose to start our application:-

```bash
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --container-name "jwtSqlApp"
```

    "email":"user@keploy.io",
    "password":"1234"
}'
```

we will get the output:

```json
{"message": "User was registered successfully!"}
```

We will get the following output in our terminal

    "email":"admin@keploy.io",
    "password":"1234",
    "role":["admin"]
}'
```

we will get the output:

```json

```

}
```

4. Access user Content

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/test/all'
```

We will get:

```
Public Content
```

5. Access user Content

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/test/user' \
--header 'x-access-token: <TOKEN>'
```

We will get

```
User Content
```

## Running the testcases

```bash
keploy test -c 'sudo docker compose up'  --container-name "jwtSqlApp" --delay 10

Our testcases will fail as the token would expire and new Token will generated again when we are using testmode. To make sure that testcases do not fail, we have use [timeFreezing](https://keploy.io/docs/keploy-cloud/time-freezing/).
