## Step 2: Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Add the following steps to your `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file:

### Install Keploy CLI

```yaml
- name: Install Keploy CLI
  run: |
    curl --silent -L https://keploy.io/ent/install.sh | bash
```

### Run Keploy API Tests

Paste the command copied from the dashboard here:

```yaml
- name: Run Keploy Test Suite
  run: |
    export KEPLOY_API_KEY=${{ secrets.KEPLOY_API_KEY }}
    keploy test-suite --app=03d24177-315c-4ee1-a3ac-64ed0ab38567 --base-path http://localhost:8080/books --cloud
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**

Don‚Äôt forget to add your `KEPLOY_API_KEY` as a GitHub secret!
**Go to your repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí _New Repository Secret_**

Replace `--app` and `--base-path` with your actual values from the Keploy Dashboard.

## Output Example: Real-time Test Execution Logs

Once integrated, here‚Äôs what a successful run may look like in your GitHub Actions console:

```sh
üê∞ Keploy: Running test suite	{"name": "Create and update one book verify other is unaffected via list"}
üê∞ Keploy: Running test case	{"name": "Create Book A"}
üê∞ Keploy: step passed	{"step": "Create Book A"}
...

+------------------------------------------+--------+-------+
| Test Case                                | Status | Runs  |
+------------------------------------------+--------+-------+
| Create book with only title              | PASSED |     1 |
| Create book with invalid progress        | PASSED |     1 |
| Delete book by very large ID             | PASSED |     1 |
| Update book by invalid ID format         | PASSED |     1 |
| ...                                      | ...    |  ...  |
+------------------------------------------+--------+-------+

Test suite execution summary
Total suites:     122
Passed suites:    122
Failed suites:      0
```

## That's it!
