Keploy can automatically fix failing test cases using its built-in AI engine. This is useful when:

- Your API responses have changed slightly (e.g. new fields, formats)
- Assertion mismatches are minor
- You want to fix many tests without editing them one-by-one

### ðŸ”§ How to Use Self-Healing

1. **Go to the Test Report**

   - Navigate to the test report where failures are listed.

2. **Click on a Failed Test**

   - Open the specific failing test case you'd like to fix.

3. **Click "Fix with AI"**

   - This will trigger Keploy AI to update the assertions based on the current API response.

4. _(Optional)_ **Add Context**

   - You can provide hints or expectations to help the AI fix it more precisely.

5. _(Optional)_ **Bulk Fix**

   - From the **Test Suites** page, select multiple suites and click **"Fix with AI"** to heal them all in one go.

6. **Wait for AI to Heal**

   - The process may take a few seconds to complete.

7. **Find Updated Tests**
   - Revisit the **Test Suites** page to view the newly healed tests.

### âœ… Best Practices

- Use AI healing after any significant backend changes.
- Review the updated assertions to ensure correctness.
- Combine healing with test deduplication to keep your suite clean.
