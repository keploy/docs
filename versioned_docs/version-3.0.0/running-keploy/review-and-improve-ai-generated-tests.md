---

After you‚Äôve generated a starter test suite with Keploy‚Äôs AI engine, the next step is to review, refine, and harden those tests so they stay trustworthy as your API evolves.

## Open the Test Review Workspace

Head to the Keploy Console ‚Üí API Test Generation ‚Ä∫ Test Suite
Based on the app that is selected, you can view the test suite for that app

## Filtering by Status, Method & Endpoint

Use the **Filter Options** bar in the left **Test‚ÄëSuites** pane to slice large suites down to exactly what you need:

| **Filter Tab**  | **How It Helps**                                                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Status Code** | Type `2` to list every 2xx, `30` for redirects, or an exact code like `404`.               |
| **HTTP Method** | Toggle to isolate `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and other verbs.                         |
| **Endpoint**    | Start typing a path fragment (e.g. `/orders`, `/auth`) to instantly narrow matching flows. |

You can **combine these filters** with the search bar‚Äîfor example, view only failed `DELETE` calls on eg: `/employees`‚Äîmaking it painless to triage huge test suites.

## Edit Test Step ‚Äì Request & Assertions

Keploy lets you refine both the **request definition** and the **assertions** from a single modal:

1. Click the ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit** icon on any step card.
2. The modal opens with two tabs:

### üì® Request Details

- Change the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, ‚Ä¶)
- Update the URL path
- Add or remove headers via `Ôºã Add Header`
- Edit the request body (JSON, form‚Äëdata, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Assertions

- Append new checks with `Ôºã Add Assertion`
- Pick the assertion type:
  - Status Code
  - Header Equal / Contains
  - Body JSONPath
  - Regex
  - Numeric `>` / `<`, etc.
- Modify comparators or expected values in‚Äëplace

### Save & Rollback

Hit **Save Changes** ‚Äì every edit is version‚Äëcontrolled so you can roll back anytime.

## Edit or Delete a Test Suite

Manage entire suites easily from the **Test Suites** list:

- **Ô∏ô Menu**: Hover over any suite row to reveal options:
  - ‚úèÔ∏è **Rename** ‚Äì Update the title and description.
  - üìÑ **Duplicate** ‚Äì Clone the suite with all steps and tags.
  - üóëÔ∏è **Delete** ‚Äì Permanently remove the suite (with confirmation).

All changes are saved instantly and logged.
