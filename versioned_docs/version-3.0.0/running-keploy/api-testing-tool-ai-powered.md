## 🤖 Why AI for API Testing?

| API Testing Challenge                           | ROI & Impact                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Edge-case, bugs, coverage flows gets missed     | Higher test coverage across CRUD and failure scenarios                                        |
| APIs change frequently, leading to broken tests | Self-healing keeps tests even when APIs evolves                                               |
| 30–50% of time spent writing tests              | 50–80% reduction in test creation <br/> Covers more edge cases within limited resources, time |

## 💥 Why Keploy? Not Other AI Testing Tools

| Capability                                             | Keploy                                                           | Most AI Tools                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Validated test execution                               | ✅ Runs and verifies each test before saving                     | ❌ Often generates unverified or broken tests |
| Full API flow coverage<br/> (Create → Update → Delete) | ✅ Supports complete multi-step flows                            | ❌ Focuses on isolated requests               |
| Edge case & negative test generation                   | ✅ Auto-detects and generates edge cases                         | ⚠️ Limited or requires manual prompting       |
| Replay across environments                             | ✅ Runs tests in dev, staging, CI with environment switching     | ⚠️ Often environment-specific or hard-coded   |
| Self-healing on API changes                            | ✅ Updates tests if API schema changes                           | ❌ No maintenance support                     |
| Flaky test detection                                   | ✅ Re-runs tests to detect instability                           | ❌ Not supported                              |
| Collaboration & governance features                    | ✅ RBAC, audit trails, tagging, Git sync                         | ❌ Basic or missing                           |
| Works from real traffic or browser flows               | ✅ Converts real traffic or frontend API interactions into tests | ⚠️ Most rely only on static specs             |

## 🚀 Keploy's API Test Generator

AI-powered testing engine that turns your API specs or traffic into stable, end-to-end test suites — no scripts, mocks, or manual setup required.

It supports:

- Generate tests from OpenAPI, Postman, or curl commands
- Run tests in any environment (dev, staging, CI)
- Edit, group, or delete test cases in the UI
- Share test reports or integrate them into CI pipelines
- Detect flaky tests and self-heal them using AI
- Record API flows via Keploy’s Chrome extension

Every test includes:

- Accurate assertions based on real responses
- Full lifecycle coverage (create → mutate → delete)
- Deduplication and flaky test detection
- Self-healing for minor API changes

Whether you're a developer, SDET, or QA manager — Keploy helps you increase test coverage, reduce test debt, and ensure reliable releases across environments.

## 🛠️ How It Works

Keploy supports multiple ways to generate test cases depending on the API access method and input format. Choose the one that fits your workflow:

| Integration Method                                                                                                      | When to Use                                                                               | How Keploy Works?                                                                                                                                |

| **Paste API Curls, Postman Collection, Schema/Swagger**<br/>[Try Now](/docs/running-keploy/generate-api-tests-using-ai) | You have OpenAPI/Swagger (YAML/JSON), Postman collection/curl, and a live public endpoint | Keploy hits multiple API cases to given endpoint and generate stable, validated tests with assertions.                                           |
| **Record via Keploy Chrome Extension**<br/>                                                                             | You don’t have specs but can interact with a web app for recording                        | Keploy captures real API calls made during UI actions and generates test cases with assertions. Adds edge cases and flow coverage automatically. |
| **Use Keploy Local Agent** <br/>[Try Now](/docs/running-keploy/generate-api-tests-using-ai)                             | Your APIs are private or behind a firewall                                                | Install the agent locally to securely test internal APIs without exposing them. No code changes required.                                        |

## ✨ Key Features

- **Self-healing tests**: Keploy auto-updates tests on minor API changes
- **Flaky test detection**: Validates each test over multiple runs
- **No redundant tests**: Automatically deduplicates similar flows
- **Environment reuse**: Change the base URL to run the same test suite elsewhere
- **One-click fix**: Use AI to repair failing tests

## ✅ Best Practices

- Start with 5+ valid curl commands or a full spec
- Use the dashboard to clean, tag, or group test cases
- Validate flows in staging before pushing to CI
- Use assertions to cover both happy paths and edge cases

- Add your API input or select a sample application (**try demo**)

- Generate and review your test suite

- You can run tests instantly, or export them into your pipeline.
