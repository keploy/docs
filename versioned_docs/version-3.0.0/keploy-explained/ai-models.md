# 🤖 AI Models at Keploy

Keploy is a vertical testing agent, built to generate high-quality unit tests using the world’s best AI.

We don’t just rely on one model—we harness the strengths of multiple cutting-edge LLMs to give you smarter, more accurate, and more relevant tests.

## 🚀 Multi-Model, Multi-Benefit

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro (Google):** Advanced reasoning, code understanding, and context awareness.
- **GPT-4 Family (OpenAI):** Exceptional language ability, coverage of edge cases, and broad code knowledge.
- **Other Specialized Models:** We continuously evaluate and integrate new AI models to keep raising the bar for testing automation.

By combining different models, Keploy can generate better test cases, filter out weak tests, and cover more scenarios.

## 🏗️ How It Works

- **Best of All Worlds:** For each test file, Keploy routes tasks to different models—letting each one play to its strengths.
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Results are validated and cross-checked, so you get fewer, but stronger and more useful tests.
- **Rapid Updates:** As AI models evolve, Keploy upgrades seamlessly—always keeping you on the leading edge.

## 🌐 Transparency & User Trust

- **No Code Used for Training:** Your code and test data are **never** used to train any external AI model.

- **Model Selection:** We choose models for you automatically, but always with a focus on security, reliability, and test quality.
