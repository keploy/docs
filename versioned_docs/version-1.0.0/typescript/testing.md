## Integration with Mocha testing framework

You just need to do some imports and call a built-in assert function in your code in your unit test file and that's it!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

```js
const {runServer} = require("../server"); //your server wrapper
const {keploy} = require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
const {describe, test, before, after} = require("mocha");
describe("test function", () => {
  before((done) => {
    keploy.setTestMode();
    runServer();
    done();
  });
  test("should be running", async () => {
    return keploy.assertTests();
  });
  after(() => {
    process.exit(1); //exits the node server
  });
});
```

Note:- To see code coverage please use nyc mocha and see how many lines are covered!!

Note:- Jest is not supported currently!!

- Furthermore, to commit your changes use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit` for better commit experience.
