## Supported Routers

### 1. Express

```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
```

The require statement should be at the top of your main file (server.js).

#### Example

```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/express/register");
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 5050;

app.use(express.json());

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.json({field: "App is healthy", opacity: Math.random()});
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port: ${port}`);
});
```

Note:- Import statements can't be used. Use require instead of import.

## Supported Dependencies

```js
require("typescript-sdk/dist/integrations/octokit/require");
```

This statement should be at the top of your main file (server.js).

Note:- Import statements can't be used. Only CommonJs support is currently provided.
