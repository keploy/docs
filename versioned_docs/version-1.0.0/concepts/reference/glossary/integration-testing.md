Integration testing is a software testing process that combines individual software modules into larger subsystems or components to evaluate the interaction between them. It is typically performed after unit testing and before system testing. The goal of integration testing is to identify any defects that arise when different modules are combined and interact with each other.

### Types of Integration Testing

There are two main types of integration testing:

1. Top-down integration testing: This type of integration testing starts with the highest-level modules and then works down to the lower-level modules.
2. Bottom-up integration testing: This type of integration testing starts with the lowest-level modules and then works up to the higher-level modules.

### How to perform Integration Testing ?

Integration testing can be performed using a variety of techniques, including:

1. Stubs: Stubs are dummy modules that are used to simulate the behavior of other modules that are not yet ready.
2. Drivers: Drivers are modules that are used to control the execution of other modules.
3. Test harnesses: Test harnesses are frameworks that automate the execution of integration tests.

### Benefits of Integration Testing

Here are some of the benefits of integration testing:

- It helps to identify defects early in the development lifecycle.
- It helps to ensure that the different modules of a software application work together as expected.
- It helps to improve the quality of the software application.
- It helps to reduce the risk of defects being found in the later stages of the development lifecycle.
