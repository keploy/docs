Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that changes made to a software application do not negatively impact existing functionality. It is typically performed after a new feature is added, a bug is fixed, or a configuration change is made.

Regression testing can be performed manually or using automated tools. Manual regression testing involves re-running a subset of test cases that have been previously executed to ensure that they still pass. Automated regression testing uses software to execute test cases automatically, which can save time and resources.

### Approaches to regression testing:

**Full regression testing**: This involves re-running all of the test cases in a test suite. This is the most comprehensive approach, but it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
**Partial regression testing**: This involves re-running a subset of test cases that are likely to be affected by the changes made to the software. This approach is more efficient than full regression testing, but it may not catch all of the potential regressions.
**Risk-based regression testing**: This approach prioritizes the test cases that are most likely to be affected by the changes made to the software. This approach can help to ensure that the most important test cases are re-run, while also minimizing the amount of time and resources that are spent on regression testing.

Regression testing is an important part of the software testing process. It helps to ensure that the software is stable and reliable, and that it continues to meet the requirements of the users.

### Benefits of regression testing:

- It helps to ensure that the software is stable and reliable.
- It helps to prevent regressions, which are defects that are introduced into the software when changes are made.
- It helps to identify potential problems with the software before they are released to users.
- It helps to save time and resources by preventing the need to fix regressions after the software is released.
