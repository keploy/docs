> Note that Testcases are exported as files in the project directory by default

To record API calls as test cases set `KEPLOY_MODE` environment variable to `record`.

```
export KEPLOY_MODE="record"
```

That's it! ðŸ”¥ As you make API calls to your application, new test-cases are being generated locally in `keploy-tests` directory.
