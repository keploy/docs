There's a separate docker-compose `docker-compose-dev.yaml` file which helps with exposing the mongo server and also builds the dockerfile from local code. The `build` flag ensures that the binary is built again to reflect the latest code changes. There's also docker-compose-debug.yaml `docker-compose-debug.yaml` which can help remote debugging the go server on port 40000.

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up --build
```

If you are not using docker, you can build and run the keploy server directly. Ensure to provide the Mongo connection string via the `KEPLOY_MONGO_URI` env variable. And also
enusre that `ENABLE_TEST_EXPORT=false` as by default it is `true` and you will not able to see testcases data in UI so make it `false` if you don't want to export test cases.

```shell
export KEPLOY_MONGO_URI="mongodb://mongo:27017"
export ENABLE_TEST_EXPORT=false
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

Keploy exposes GraphQL API for the frontend based on [gqlgen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen). After changing the schema `graph/schema.graphqls` you can autogenerate graphQL handlers `graph/schema.resolvers.go` using

```shell
go generate ./...
```

Note:- As we follow conventional commits so we encourage you to also follow that while making commits. You can know more about them on [here](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).
