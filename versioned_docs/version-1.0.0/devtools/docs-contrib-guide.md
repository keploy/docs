# Contribute to Keploy Docs Website

We encourage contributions from the community.

**Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/keploy/docs/issues) for any changes beyond typos and small fixes.**

If you do create a pull request (PR), please follow our [style guidance](https://github.com/keploy/docs/blob/main/STYLE.md).

We review GitHub issues and PRs on a regular schedule.

To ensure that each change is relevant and properly peer reviewed, please adhere to best practices for open-source contributions.
This means that if you are outside the Keploy organization, you must fork the repository and create PRs from branches on your own fork.
The README in GitHub's [first-contributions repo](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) provides an example.

## How to set up the docs website locally?

The Keploy documentation site uses [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), which is a static website generator.

You can make changes locally without previewing them in the browser.
However, if you want to build the site and preview changes in the browser, you need to have [Docusaurus 2 dependencies](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/installation/#requirements) installed.

Initialize Docusaurus 2 in the repo by running [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/) once in the root directory of the repo.

Now you can build and view the site locally:

```bash
yarn start
```

The command starts a local development server and opens a browser window.

## Prettier

1. Fork the repository

<br/>

2. Clone the repository with the following command. Replace the {'<'}GITHUB_USERNAME{'>'} with your username

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/docs.git
```

<br/>

3. Go into the directory containing the project

```sh
cd docs
```

<br/>

4. Install all the dependencies

```sh
yarn
```

<br/>

5. Start the development server.

```sh
yarn start
```

6. To reformat:

```
yarn prettier --write '**/*.{js,md}'
```

When we merge your PR, a new build automatically occurs and your changes publish to [https://docs.keploy.io](https://docs.keploy.io).

## How to Suggest UI/UX Improvements?

One of the most important areas of improvement to our software Keploy UI. We really need your help with this!

If you have ideas on how we can improve, please share them with us by creating a [new issue](https://github.com/keploy/ui/issues/new/choose).

## How to Contribute Translations?

Right now our interfaces do not support translations and we also don't have a translation strategy in place. But we want to change this. We want our projects to be accessible to non-English speakers. If you have any ideas then please share them with us by creating a [new issue].
