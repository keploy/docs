# Using the Local Agent

This guide explains how to use the local agent in Keploy to test private or local endpoints. Follow the steps below to set up and use the local agent effectively.

## Steps to Use the Local Agent

1. **Enter the Endpoint URL**
   - Navigate to the local agent section in the Keploy interface.
   - Enter the endpoint URL you want to test. This can be a private URL or any other endpoint.
   - A default localhost link is also available for convenience.

2. **Download the Keplr Agent**
   - Based on your device configuration, download the Keplr agent:
     - **Windows**
     - **Mac**
     - **Linux**
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. **Start the Keplr Agent**
   - Once the agent is downloaded, start it on your device.
   - Open the agent interface to ensure it is running and ready to connect.

4. **Connect the Agent**
   - After starting the agent, connect it to Keploy.
   - Once connected, you can begin making API calls.

5. **Record API Calls**
   - The Keplr agent will automatically record the API calls you make.
   - It will capture the responses and start generating test sheets based on the recorded calls.

6. **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**
   - If the local agent fails to connect, you can use the Keplr extension as an alternative.
   - Ensure that the agent is running and the endpoint URL is correct.

By following these steps, you can efficiently use the local agent to test your APIs and generate test sheets automatically.
