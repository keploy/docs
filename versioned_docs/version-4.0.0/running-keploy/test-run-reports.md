## 🧩 Test Suites

Manage and fine-tune your test suites for each API endpoint. You can edit request inputs, response expectations, and assertion types.

### ✏️ Editable Test Cases

Each test case can be modified to:

- Change the **request payload**, headers, or query parameters
- Edit or update **expected response bodies**
- Select or modify **assertion types**

### 🧪 Supported Assertion Types

| Assertion Type     | Description                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `statusCode`       | Asserts the HTTP status code matches expected (e.g., 200, 404) |
| `bodyContains`     | Checks if the response body includes specific text or keys     |
| `jsonEquals`       | Validates deep equality of the JSON response                   |
| `headerMatch`      | Asserts presence or value of specific response headers         |
| `schemaValidation` | Validates against OpenAPI/JSON schema if available             |
| `custom`           | User-defined scripts or match rules                            |

#### ➕ Example Test Case Structure (YAML)

```yaml
- testName: Get All Users
  method: GET
  endpoint: /users
  expectedStatus: 200
  assertions:
    - type: statusCode
    - type: bodyContains
      value: "username"
    - type: jsonEquals
      expected:
        - id: 1
          username: john_doe
```

### 🧱 Edit Test Step

Easily customize individual test steps to simulate real-world API usage and validate your app’s behavior under different conditions.

#### 🔧 Request Details

- **Name:**  
  `Create Object P024 Invalid JSON`

- **Method:**
