Keploy can be integrated with GitHub by two methods:-

1. [Using Shell Scripts](#shell-scripts)
2. [Using GitHub Actions](#github-actions)

You can also [run cloud replay from your CI pipeline](#running-cloud-replay-in-ci).

## Shell Scripts

GitHub scripts are the easiest way to integrate Keploy with GitHub. We will be using [express-mongoose](https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose) sample-application for the example. You can either add the following script to your `github workflow` or create a new workflow `.github/workflows/keploy-test.yml`:-

```yaml
- name: Checkout Commit
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Keploy Tests
  id: keploy-run-test
  run: |
    curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz --overwrite -C /tmp
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin/keploy
  ...
```

### Example with Scripts

While using [express-mongoose](https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose) sample-application with keploy test in GitHub CI, the workflow would like:-

```yaml
- name: Checkout Commit
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
- name: Set up Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v2
  with:
    node-version: 18

- name: Keploy Tests
  id: keploy-run-test
  run: |
    curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz --overwrite -C /tmp
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin/keploy

    # Install application dependencies
    npm install

    # Run the keploy captured tests
    keploy test -c "node src/app.js"
```

We will get to see output : -

```sh

## GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions are a more advanced way to integrate Keploy with GitHub. We will be using [express-mongoose](https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose) sample-application for the example. Create a new workflow under `.github/workflow` with the name `keploy-test.yml`: -

```yaml
jobs:
  my_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Test-Report
        uses: keploy/testgpt@main
        with:
          command: "<CMD_TO_RUN_APP>" ## Command to run the application
```

In the above example, we are using the `keploy/testgpt` action to run the test cases.

> - `working-directory` (optional) is the path to the application by default it takes root to find keploy folder.
> - `delay` (optional) is the time to wait for the application to start.
> - `command` is the command to run your application.

### Example with Actions

While using [express-mongoose](https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose) sample-application with keploy test in GitHub CI via actions, the workflow would like:-

```yaml
jobs:
  keploy_test_case:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Test-Report
        uses: keploy/testgpt@main
        with:
          working-directory: /express-mongoose
          delay: 10
          command: "node src/app.js"
```

> **Note: `keploy/testgpt` action supports only amd_64 based runners.**

We will get to see output : -

```sh
Test Mode Starting 🎉
sudo -E keploy test -c node src/app.js --delay 10 --path ./

## Running cloud replay in CI

Keploy cloud replay re-runs test sets that were recorded from a Kubernetes deployment. It works with both **Keploy Cloud** and a **self-hosted Keploy** setup, and on any CI control plane — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, and others.

### How authentication works

The CLI reads the `KEPLOY_API_KEY` environment variable automatically — no browser login needed.

- **Locally:** `export KEPLOY_API_KEY="<your-api-key>"` before running the command.
- **In CI:** store the key as a secret in your CI system so it gets injected as an environment variable at runtime. Never hard-code it in your pipeline file.

> Cloud replay requires the Enterprise binary. Install it with `curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/ent/install.sh && source install.sh` — not the open-source `keploy.io/install.sh`.

### Steps

1. **Store the API key** — add `KEPLOY_API_KEY` as a secret in your CI system.
   - GitHub Actions: go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**, name it `KEPLOY_API_KEY`.
   - GitLab CI: go to **Settings → CI/CD → Variables**, add it as a masked variable.
   - Jenkins: add a **Secret text** credential via **Manage Jenkins → Credentials**.
2. **Install** the Enterprise Keploy binary on the runner.
3. **Run** `keploy cloud replay` with your application and cluster details.

### Example: GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Keploy Cloud Replay

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  keploy-cloud-replay:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      KEPLOY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.KEPLOY_API_KEY }}
    steps:
      - name: Install Keploy Enterprise
        run: |
          curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/ent/install.sh && source install.sh

      - name: Cloud replay
        run: |
          keploy cloud replay \
            --app "<NAMESPACE>.<DEPLOYMENT>" \
            --cluster "<CLUSTER>" \
            --namespace "<NAMESPACE>" \
            --delay <DELAY>
```

Replace `<NAMESPACE>`, `<DEPLOYMENT>`, `<CLUSTER>`, and `<DELAY>` with your own values. Set `<DELAY>` (in seconds) to comfortably cover your application's startup time.

> `KEPLOY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.KEPLOY_API_KEY }}` pulls the value from GitHub's secret store and makes it available as an environment variable in all subsequent steps.
