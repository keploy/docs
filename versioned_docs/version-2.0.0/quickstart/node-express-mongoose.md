## Introduction

A simple sample CRUD application and see how seamlessly Keploy integrates with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Buckle up, it's gonna be a fun ride! 🎢

import InstallationGuide from '../concepts/installation.md'

<InstallationGuide/>

## Get Started! 🎬

Clone the repository and move to express-mongoose folder

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript && cd samples-typescript/express-mongoose

# Install the dependencies
npm install
```

## Installation 📥

Depending on your OS, choose your adventure:
There are 2 ways you can run this sample application.

- [Using Docker compose : running application as well as MongoDb on Docker container](#using-docker-compose-)
- [Using Docker container for mongoDb and running application locally](#running-app-locally-on-linuxwsl-)

## Using Docker Compose 🐳

We will be using Docker compose to run the application as well as MongoDb on Docker container.

### Lights, Camera, Record! 🎥

Fire up the application and mongoDB instance with Keploy. Keep an eye on the two key flags:
`-c`: Command to run the app (e.g., `docker compose up`).

`--containerName`: The container name in the `docker-compose.yml` for traffic interception.

```bash
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --containerName "nodeMongoApp" --buildDelay 50
```

🔥 Challenge time! Generate some test cases. How? Just **make some API calls**. Postman, Hoppscotch or even curl - take your pick!

#### Let's generate the testcases.

Make API Calls using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io), [Postman](https://postman.com) or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url http://localhost:8000/students \
 --header 'content-type: application/json' \
 --data '{
  "name":"John Do",
  "email":"john@xyiz.com",
  "phone":"0123456799"
  }'
```

Here's a peek of what you get:

```
Student registration successful!
```

🎉 Woohoo! With a simple API call, you've crafted a test case with a mock! Dive into the Keploy directory and feast your eyes on the newly minted `test-1.yml` and `mocks.yml`

_Time to perform more API magic!_
Follow the breadcrumbs... or Make more API Calls

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url http://localhost:8080/students
```

Or simply wander over to your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/students`.

Did you spot the new test and mock scrolls in your project library? Awesome! 👏

### Run Tests

Time to put things to the test 🧪

```bash
keploy test -c "docker compose up" --containerName "nodeMongoApp" --buildDelay 50 --delay 10
```

> The `--delay` flag? Oh, that's just giving your app a little breather (in seconds) before the test cases come knocking.

Your results should be looking all _snazzy_, like this:

Worry not, just add the ever-changing fields (like our **ts** here) to the **noise parameter** to **dodge those assertions**.

### Wrapping it up 🎉

Congrats on the journey so far! You've seen Keploy's power, flexed your coding muscles, and had a bit of fun too! Now, go out there and keep exploring, innovating, and creating! Remember, with the right tools and a sprinkle of fun, anything's possible.😊🚀

Happy coding! ✨👩‍💻👨‍💻✨

## Running App Locally on Linux/WSL 🐧

We'll be running our sample application right on Linux, but just to make things a tad more thrilling, we'll have the database (mongoDB) chill on Docker. Ready? Let's get the party started!🎉

If you are using WSL on windows then use below to start wsl in the user's home directory:

```bash
wsl ~
```

First things first, update the MongoDB URL on line 4, in **`db/connection.js`**, from `mongodb://mongoDb:27017/keploy` to `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/keploy`.

#### 🍃 Kickstart MongoDB

We are going to run a mongo docker container which requires an existing docker network. We need to run the following command to create the required docker network:

```bash
docker network create keploy-network
```

Now, let's breathe life into your mongo container. A simple spell should do the trick:

```bash
docker compose up mongo
```

### 📼 Roll the Tape - Recording Time!

Ready, set, record! Here's how:

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy record -c 'node src/app.js'
```

Keep an eye out for the `-c `flag! It's the command charm to run the app.

Alright, magician! With the app alive and kicking, let's weave some test cases. The spell? Making some API calls! Postman, Hoppscotch, or the classic curl - pick your wand.

#### Let's generate the testcases.

Make API Calls using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io), [Postman](https://postman.com) or cURL command. Keploy with capture those calls to generate the test-suites containing testcases and data mocks.

```bash
curl --request POST \
--url http://localhost:8000/students \
--header 'content-type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name":"John Do",
  "email":"john@xyiz.com",
  "phone":"0123456799"
  }'
```

Here's a peek of what you get:

```
Student registration successful!
```

🎉 Woohoo! Give yourself a pat on the back! With that simple spell, you've conjured up a test case with a mock! Explore the **Keploy directory** and you'll discover your handiwork in `test-1.yml` and `mocks.yml`.

<img src="/docs/img/testcase-node.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Result Node MongoDB" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

Now, the real fun begins. Let's weave more spells!

🚀 Follow the URL road...!

```bash
curl --request GET \  --url http://localhost:8080/students
```

Or simply wander over to your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/students`.

Did you spot the new test and mock scrolls in your project library? Awesome! 👏

### Run Tests 🏁

Ready to put your spells to the test?

```bash
sudo -E env PATH=$PATH keploy test -c "node src/app.js" --delay 10
```

Worry not, just add the ever-changing fields (like our **ts** here) to the **noise parameter** to **dodge those assertions**.

<img src="/docs/img/testrun-node-pass.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Result Node MongoDB" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />
