## Introduction

ðŸª„ Dive into the world of realtime subscriptions and see how seamlessly Keploy integrates with [SSE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Buckle up, it's gonna be a fun ride! ðŸŽ¢

## Installation ðŸ“¥

Ways you can run this sample application.

- [Using Docker container for MongoDB and running application locally](#installation-setup)

## Installation Setup

#### Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-go.git && cd samples-go/sse-svelte
go mod download
```

### Start MongoDB Instance

Using the docker-compose file we will start our mongodb instance:-

```bash
# Start Postgres
docker-compose up mongo
```

### Build Application Binary

Now, we will create the binary of our application:-

```bash
go build -cover
```

Once we have our applicaiton binary ready, we will start the application with keploy to start capturing the testcases.

## Capture the test cases

```bash
sudo -E keploy record "./sse-mongo"
```

### Start the UI

We will capture our test from the UI written in Svelte.js

```bash
cd svelte-app && npm install && npm run dev
```

Now let's click on `GetTime` button to trigger the event. We would notice that keploy will capture those calls : -

## Run the Testcases

Now let's run the test mode :-

```shell
keploy test -c "./sse-mongo" --delay 10 --goCoverage
```

Output should look like : -

So no need to setup fake database/apis like Postgres or write mocks for them. Keploy automatically mocks them and, **The application thinks it's talking to MongoDb ðŸ˜„**. And with just few clicks we were able to get 42% code coverage of our go backend application.
