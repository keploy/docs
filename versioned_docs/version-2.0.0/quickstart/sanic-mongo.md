## Introduction

This application is a simple movie management API built using Python's [Sanic framework](https://sanic.dev/en/) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) for data storage. It allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Movie records.

<InstallationGuide/>

# Get Started! ðŸŽ¬

## Clone the app ðŸ§ª

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-python.git && cd samples-python/sanic-mongo
```

## Download the requirements.txt file and DB setup

Head to the folder of the application and run

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Open a different terminal and setup your MongoDB through docker

```shell
sudo docker network create keploy-network
```

```shell
docker run -p 27017:27017 -d --rm --name mongoDB --net keploy-network mongo
```

## Lights, Camera, Record! ðŸŽ¥

Capture the test-cases-

```shell
keploy record -c "python3 server.py"
```

You should be able to see this in your terminal

ðŸ”¥**Make some API calls**. Postman, Hoppscotch or even curl - take your pick!

Let's make URLs short and sweet:

## Generate testcases

To generate testcases we just need to **make some API calls.**

1. **Make a POST request:**

```bash
  curl -X "POST" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/add_movie" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
    -d '{
        "name": "Whiplash"
    }'
```

2. **Make a GET request:**

```bash
  curl -X "GET" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies" \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8'
```

3. **Make a DELETE request:**

```bash
  curl -X "DELETE" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies" \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8'

```

And once you are done, you can stop the recording and give yourself a pat on the back! With that simple spell, you've conjured up a test case with a mock! Explore the **keploy** directory and you'll discover your handiwork in `tests` directory and `mocks.yml`.

This is an example of what your mocks would look like

```yaml
version: api.keploy.io/v1beta1
kind: Mongo
name: mock-0
spec:
  metadata:
    operation: '{ OpQuery flags: [], fullCollectionName: admin.$cmd, numberToSkip: 0, numberToReturn: -1, query: {"ismaster": {"$numberInt":"1"},"helloOk": true,"client": {"driver": {"name": "PyMongo|Motor","version": "4.6.3|3.4.0"},"os": {"type": "Linux","name": "Linux","architecture": "x86_64","version": "5.15.146.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2"},"platform": "CPython 3.10.12.final.0|asyncio"}}, returnFieldsSelector:  }'

```

## **Time to put things to the test ðŸ§ª:**

```bash
 keploy test -c "python server.py"
```

This is how your terminal would look like :

You can experiment with different API calls, modify the database response in mocks.yml, or adjust the request or response in test-x.yml. Then, run the tests again to see the change in response
