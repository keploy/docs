# Example Employee-Manager App

A sample Employee-Manager app to test Keploy integration capabilities using **SpringBoot**
and **PostgreSQL**.

> This sample application is **not written for macOS users** since this application doesn't have a docker file yet.

import InstallationGuide from '../concepts/installation.md'

<InstallationGuide/>

## Setup Employee-Manager App

### Application Pre-Requisites 📋

- Java 1.8+ or <17 ☕
- Maven 🛠️

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-java && cd samples-java/employee-manager
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

## Start the Postgres DB 🐳

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Note: You may have to use sudo if you are not part of the docker group.

### Capture the testcases 🎬

Once we have our jar file ready,this command will start the recording of API calls using ebpf:-

```bash
keploy record -c "java -jar target/springbootapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
```

![Testcases](https://github.com/keploy/samples-java/blob/main/employee-manager/img/test-cases.png?raw=true)

Now let's run a few tests to capture some more scenarios:

#### Generate testcases 📝

To generate testcases we just need to **make some API calls.** You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
, [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`

1. Make an employee entry 📥

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/employees' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp":1
}'
```

this will return the response or an entry. The timestamp would automatically be ignored during testing because it'll
always be different.

```bash
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp": 1661493301
}
```

2. Fetch recorded info about employees

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1'
```

or by querying through the browser `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1`

Now both these API calls were captured as **editable** testcases and written to `keploy/test` folder. The keploy
directory would also have `mock.yml` file.

Now, let's see the magic! 🪄💫

## Run the test cases

First lets shutdown the database to verify that keploy's magic is taking care of the database mocking. No need to worry
about the database anymore! 🎉

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Now, let's run the keploy in test mode: -

```bash
keploy test -c "java -jar target/springbootapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" --delay 10
```

This will run the testcases and generate the report in `keploy/testReports` folder. You will see the following output:-

Did you spot that the `timestamp` is showing some differences? Yep, time has a way of doing that! 🕰️

Worry not, just add the ever-changing fields (like our **ts** here) to the **noise parameter** to **dodge those assertions**.

> Pro tip: Add `body.timestamp` to noise in `test-1.yaml`.

<img src="/docs/img/code-snippets/java-sample-employee-manager-noise.png" alt="Adding Noise to Test case Java Postgres Employee Manager App" width="70%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }}/>

Run that `keploy test` command once more and watch as everything falls into place with all tests passing! 🌟

Final thoughts? Dive deeper! Try different API calls, tweak the DB response in the `mocks.yml`, or fiddle with the request or response in `test-x.yml`. Run the tests again and see the magic unfold! ✨👩‍💻👨‍💻✨

### 🎉 Wrapping it up

Congrats on the journey so far! You've seen Keploy's power, flexed your coding muscles, and had a bit of fun too! Now, go out there and keep exploring, innovating, and creating! Remember, with the right tools and a sprinkle of fun, anything's possible. 😊🚀

Happy coding! ✨👩‍💻👨‍💻✨
