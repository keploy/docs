# Example Employee-Manager App

A sample Employee-Manager app to test Keploy integration capabilities using **SpringBoot**
and **PostgreSQL**.

> If you are **macOS users** please try the application using docker compose.

import InstallationGuide from '../concepts/installation.md'

<InstallationGuide/>

## Setup Employee-Manager App

### Application Pre-Requisites

- Java 1.8+ or {'<'}17 ☕
- Maven 🛠️

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keploy/samples-java && cd samples-java/employee-manager
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

You can start the backend using Keploy in 2 ways:

- [Using Keploy's binary](#instructions-for-starting-using-binary)
- [Using Keploy's docker image](#instructions-for-starting-using-docker)

## Instructions For Starting Using Binary

### Setup the backend

You need to update the postgresql properties, go to
`employee-manager/src/main/resources/application-postgresql.properties`
and change

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/keploy-test/
```

to

```bash
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/keploy-test/
```

and then build the jar using:

```bash
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

### Start the Postgres DB 🐳

```bash
docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=keploy-user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=keploy -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres -p 5432:5432 --name postgres postgres:15.2
```

Note: You may have to use sudo if you are not part of the docker group.

### Capture the testcases 🎬

```bash
keploy record -c "java -jar target/springbootapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"
```

![Testcases](/img/keploy-record-docker-employee-app.png)

Now let's run a few tests to capture some more scenarios:

#### Generate testcases 📝

To generate testcases we just need to **make some API calls.** You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
, [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`

1. Make an employee entry 📥

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/employees' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp":1
}'
```

this will return the response or an entry. The timestamp would automatically be ignored during testing because it'll
always be different.

```bash
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp": 1661493301
}
```

2. Fetch recorded info about employees

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1'
```

or by querying through the browser `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1`

Now both these API calls were captured as **editable** testcases and written to `keploy/test` folder. The keploy
directory would also have `mock.yml` file.

Now, let's see the magic! 🪄💫

### Run the test cases

First lets shutdown the database to verify that keploy's magic is taking care of the database mocking. No need to worry
about the database anymore! 🎉

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Now, let's run the keploy in test mode: -

```bash
keploy test -c "java -jar target/springbootapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" --delay 10
```

This will run the testcases and generate the report in `keploy/reports` folder. You will see the following output:-

````shell

Did you spot that the `timestamp` is showing some differences? Yep, time has a way of doing that! 🕰️

Worry not, just add the ever-changing fields (like our **ts** here) to the **noise parameter** to **dodge those assertions**.

> Pro tip: Add `body.timestamp` to noise in `keploy.yml`.

<img src="/docs/img/test-noise-employee-app.png" alt="Adding Noise to Test case Java Postgres Employee Manager App" width="70%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }}/>

Run that `keploy test` command once more and watch as everything falls into place with all tests passing! 🌟

Final thoughts? Dive deeper! Try different API calls, tweak the DB response in the `mocks.yml`, or fiddle with the request or response in `test-x.yml`. Run the tests again and see the magic unfold! ✨👩‍💻👨‍💻✨

Next we move on to the instructions to start the application using docker.

## Instructions For Starting Using Docker

Prerequisites For Docker:

1.  Docker Desktop 4.25.2 and above or docker cli installed

Here we just need to change the command used to start the application.

### Capture the testcases 🎬

```bash
keploy record -c "docker compose up" --container-name javaApp --build-delay 100
```

<img src="/docs/img/Keploy-record-docker-compose-employee-app.png" alt="Sample Keploy Record Java" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

Now let's run a few tests to capture some more scenarios:

#### Generate testcases 📝

To generate testcases we just need to **make some API calls.** You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
, [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), or simply `curl`

1. Make an employee entry 📥

```bash

--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp":1
}'
```

this will return the response or an entry. The timestamp would automatically be ignored during testing because it'll
always be different.

```bash
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Myke",
    "lastName": "Tyson",
    "email": "mt@gmail.com",
    "timestamp": 1661493301
}
```

2. Fetch recorded info about employees

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1'
```

or by querying through the browser `http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1`

Now both these API calls were captured as **editable** testcases and written to `keploy/test` folder. The keploy
directory would also have `mock.yml` file.

Now, let's see the magic! 🪄💫

### Running the testcases using Keploy

```bash
keploy test -c "docker compose up" --container-name javaApp --build-delay 50 --delay 20
```

Your CLI should look something like this
<img src="/docs/img/keploy-test-docker-compose-command.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Java" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

This is a summary of the test cases recorded
<img src="/docs/img/Keploy-test-docker-compose-employee-app.png" alt="Sample Keploy Test Summary Java" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }} />

Here `delay` is the time it takes for your application to get started, after which Keploy will start running the testcases. If your application takes longer than 10s to get started, you can change the `delay` accordingly.
`buildDelay` is the time that it takes for the image to get built. This is useful when you are building the docker image from your docker compose file itself.

### 🎉 Wrapping it up

Congrats on the journey so far! You've seen Keploy's power, flexed your coding muscles, and had a bit of fun too! Now, go out there and keep exploring, innovating, and creating! Remember, with the right tools and a sprinkle of fun, anything's possible. 😊🚀
