AI Test Completion refers to leveraging LLM's, and GenAI to either automate and assist in the creation or execution and maintenance of test cases.
It is used to enhance testing efficiency, coverage, and accuracy by leveraging AI to predict and generate tests which can help in increasing code coverage.

## How does testing with AI works ?

Typically using AI for test involves the multiple steps, such as:

1. **Training Phase**: AI models are trained on historical test data including past test cases, outcomes, and behavior of application.

2. **Prediction**: The AI analyze patterns in the source codebase to predict potential test scenarios as well as edge scenarios and then generate test cases automatically.

3. **Feedback**: Generated test cases are validated against the system under test and feedback from these executions is used to refine and improve the AI models.

## What are Advantages of AI Tests ?

- **Increased Efficiency**: Automates test case generation and execution, reducing manual effort and time spent on repetitive tasks.
- **Enhanced Coverage**: AI can identify edge cases and scenarios that may be overlooked by human testers, improving test coverage.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Reduces human error in testing by applying consistent and objective criteria to test case creation and execution.
- **Cost-Effective**: Saves costs associated with manual testing efforts and allows testers to focus on more complex and critical tasks.
- **Scalability**: It can easily scales to handle large and complex software systems, accommodating rapid changes and updates.

## What are disadvantages of AI Tests ?

- **Dependency on Data Quality**: AI models heavily rely on the quality and relevance of training data. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate predictions and test cases.
- **Initial Setup Complexity**: Setting up AI models and integrating them into existing testing frameworks can be complex and time-consuming.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Requires ongoing maintenance and updates to AI models as software systems evolve and new test scenarios emerge.
- **Lack of Human Judgment**: AI may struggle with subjective aspects of testing that require human judgment and intuition.
- **Security Concerns**: Introducing AI into testing processes may raise security concerns related to data privacy and integrity.
- **Integration Challenges**: Integrating AI-driven testing tools with existing CI/CD pipelines and workflows can present integration challenges.
