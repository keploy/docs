Software Testing Life Cycle, more commonly known as STLC, is a process to test software applications to ensure they meet quality standards, fulfill requirements, and perform as expected. STLC consists of several phases that guide the testing process from inception to completion, ensuring thorough testing and defect identification.

## What are the Phases of Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) comprises several phases that guide the testing process from inception to completion. The key phases include:

1. **Requirement Analysis**:

   - **Objective**: Understand software requirements and define test objectives.
   - **Activities**: Review requirements, identify testable features, and plan test strategy.

2. **Test Planning**:

   - **Objective**: Define test scope, resources, and timelines.
   - **Activities**: Develop test plan, determine testing types, and establish metrics.

3. **Test Design**:

   - **Objective**: Create detailed test cases and scenarios.
   - **Activities**: Write test cases, define test data, and prioritize tests.

4. **Test Environment Setup**:

   - **Objective**: Prepare the testing infrastructure.
   - **Activities**: Configure hardware, software, and test tools.

5. **Test Execution**:

   - **Objective**: Execute test cases and identify defects.
   - **Activities**: Run tests, log results, and capture evidence.

6. **Defect Reporting**:

   - **Objective**: Document and prioritize defects.
   - **Activities**: Report issues, classify severity, and assign to developers.

7. **Defect Retesting and Regression Testing**:

   - **Objective**: Verify defect fixes and ensure no new issues arise.
   - **Activities**: Re-execute failed tests, perform regression testing, and validate fixes.

8. **Test Closure**:
   - **Objective**: Assess testing completion and readiness for release.
   - **Activities**: Evaluate test results, generate reports, and obtain stakeholder sign-off.

## What are some common Practices in STLC ?

- **Automation Testing**: Automate repetitive tests to save time and improve accuracy.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate testing into development cycles for early defect detection.
- **Risk-Based Testing**: Prioritize tests based on potential impact and likelihood of failure.
- **Performance Testing**: Evaluate software performance under various conditions and loads.
