## What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach that aligns software development with business goals through clear, readable test scenarios. TDD is a collaborative approach that involves developers, testers, and business analysts working together to define the requirements and test scenarios before writing the code.

## When to work with TDD ?

TDD is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **New Features Development**: TDD is highly effective when developing new features or functionalities for an application. By writing tests first, developers can clearly define the expected behavior of the feature and ensure that it meets the specified requirements.

- **Refactoring Legacy Code**: When refactoring legacy code or making significant changes to an existing codebase, TDD can provide a safety net to ensure that the behavior of the code remains unchanged. Writing tests before refactoring allows developers to verify that the existing functionality is preserved throughout the process.

- **Bug Fixing and Troubleshooting**: TDD can be beneficial when fixing bugs or troubleshooting issues in the codebase. By writing tests that reproduce the bug or issue first, developers can ensure that the bug is fixed properly and does not reappear in future iterations.

- **Ensuring Code Quality**: TDD helps ensure code quality by encouraging developers to write testable, modular, and maintainable code. Writing tests first forces developers to consider edge cases, error scenarios, and boundary conditions, resulting in more robust and reliable code.

## How Keploy with TDD works ?

Keploy can be integrated into your TDD workflow to automate testing processes and streamline development.

Here's how you can do TDD with Keploy:

- **Write a Failing Test**: Begin by writing a test case for a specific functionality or requirement of your application. The test should fail initially since the corresponding functionality has not been implemented yet.

- **Run the Test with Keploy**: Use Keploy to execute the test case you've written. Since the test is expected to fail initially, Keploy will indicate that the test has failed.
  Implement the Code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the failing test pass. Focus on implementing the functionality required to satisfy the test case.

- **Run the Test Again**: After implementing the code, rerun the test using Keploy. If the test passes, it indicates that the implemented code meets the requirements specified by the test case.

- **Refactor the Code**: Once the test passes, you can refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or performance. Ensure that the test continues to pass after refactoring.

- **Repeat the Cycle**: Repeat the process for each new functionality or requirement of your application. Write a failing test, implement the code, run the test, and refactor as necessary.

- **Monitor Code Coverage**: Use Keploy to monitor code coverage metrics during the TDD process. Ensure that your tests cover all relevant code paths and functionalities of your application.

- **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate Keploy into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the execution of tests and ensure that TDD practices are followed consistently across your development workflow.
