## What is TDD?

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology that ensures alignment between code implementation and business goals by defining clear, concise, and testable requirements upfront. In TDD, developers, testers, and business analysts collaborate to write test cases before the actual code, driving development with well-defined test scenarios.

## When to use TDD?

Test Driven Development or TDD is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- **New Features Development**: TDD helps define expected behavior for new features, ensuring they meet specified requirements. Writing tests first leads to more predictable and robust feature implementation.

- **Refactoring Legacy Code**: TDD provides a safety net during legacy code refactoring, ensuring existing functionality remains intact. Tests written before refactoring validate the unchanged behavior.

- **Bug Fixing and Troubleshooting**: Writing a test to replicate a bug ensures that the issue is fixed correctly and doesnâ€™t recur in future iterations.

- **Ensuring Code Quality**: By writing tests first, developers are encouraged to consider edge cases and boundary conditions, leading to modular, maintainable, and error-resistant code.

## What are the Fundamentals of TDD?

1. **Write a Failing Test**: Start by writing a test that specifies a function or improvement. This test should fail initially since the feature is not yet implemented.
2. **Implement the Minimum Code**: Write the smallest amount of code needed to make the test pass. Prioritize functionality over optimization.
3. **Refactor the Code**: Once the test passes, refine the code for clarity, efficiency, and maintainability while ensuring it still passes the test.
4. **Repeat the Cycle**: Iterate this cycle for each feature, maintaining a steady rhythm of testing, coding, and refactoring.

## What are the Techniques of implementing TDD?

1. **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**:
   - **Red**: Write a test that fails.
   - **Green**: Write code to make the test pass.
   - **Refactor**: Clean up the code while ensuring the test still passes.
2. **Mocking and Stubbing**: Use mocks and stubs to isolate the unit of code being tested, allowing you to focus on the specific functionality without dependencies on external systems or services.
3. **Pair Programming**: Work in pairs to write tests and code collaboratively, enhancing code quality and knowledge sharing.
4. **Test Coverage Monitoring**: Continuously monitor test coverage to ensure all relevant code paths are tested. Aim for high coverage but prioritize meaningful and maintainable tests over achieving 100% coverage.
5. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate tests into the CI pipeline to automate test execution with each code commit, providing rapid feedback on code quality and functionality.
6. **Behavioral Testing**: Although primarily focused on unit testing, incorporate behavioral tests to ensure that the system behaves as expected from the user's perspective. Use tools like JUnit for Java or pytest for Python.

## How Keploy works with Test Driven Development ?

Keploy can be integrated into your Test Driven Development workflow to automate testing processes and streamline development.

Here's how you can perform TDD with Keploy:

- **Write a Failing Test**: Begin by writing a test case for a specific functionality or requirement of your application. The test should fail initially since the corresponding functionality has not been implemented yet.

- **Run the Test with Keploy**: Use Keploy to execute the test case you've written. Since the test is expected to fail initially, Keploy will indicate that the test has failed.
  Implement the Code: Write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the failing test pass. Focus on implementing the functionality required to satisfy the test case.

- **Run the Test Again**: After implementing the code, rerun the test using Keploy. If the test passes, it indicates that the implemented code meets the requirements specified by the test case.

- **Refactor the Code**: Once the test passes, you can refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, or performance. Ensure that the test continues to pass after refactoring.

- **Repeat the Cycle**: Repeat the process for each new functionality or requirement of your application. Write a failing test, implement the code, run the test, and refactor as necessary.

- **Monitor Code Coverage**: Use Keploy to monitor code coverage metrics during the Test Driven Development process. Ensure that your tests cover all relevant code paths and functionalities of your application.

- **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrate Keploy into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the execution of tests and ensure that Test Driven Development practices are followed consistently across your development workflow.
