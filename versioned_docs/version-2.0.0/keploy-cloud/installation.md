## Introduction 📘

#### Welcome to the Keploy Cloud Guide!

In this guide, you will find information about Keploy Cloud, onboarding, features, and how to use them.

#### Requesting a Keploy Cloud Account

To request a Keploy Cloud account, please complete the request form [here](https://forms.gle/jGBbyRyh9H7AKXZX6). Our team will review your request and get back to you as soon as possible.

#### Getting Started with Keploy Cloud

Once your account is set up, you can start exploring the various features of Keploy Cloud. Here are some key features to can get started with:

- **AI-Driven Test Generation** 🧠: Keploy will automatically uncover your API's edge cases and generate test cases to expose more code paths, thereby increasing code coverage.

- **Test Deduplication** 📊 : Keploy detects duplicate/redundant tests automatically, which will be particularly useful if you plan to record numerous scenarios from a live environment and wish to retain only unique scenario tests.

- **Keploy Console** 📈: We are ensuring a smooth experience of visualising bugs found with Keploy and sharing reports with your team.

- **Asynchronous Processes Support** ⏱ : Keploy V2 captures and replays asynchronous tasks effectively. We're also incorporating support for adding custom user-defined behaviours or assertions.

- **Time Freezing** ❄️: Keploy Cloud allows you to freeze/rollback the time in every test run, back to when the test case was recorded. This allows developers to ensure time-sensitive objects don’t expire or change, making tests consistent and more reliable.

To get started with Keploy Cloud, you will need to install the Keploy Cloud Agent and authenticate your account.

## Installation 🛠️

Install and Validate the Keploy Cloud Agent by following the steps below:

```bash
curl --silent -O -L https://keploy.io/ent/install.sh && source install.sh
```

Enter your **API Key** when prompted, ask your org Admin to re-regenerate the API key in case you lose it.

Once validated, you can start using Keploy Cloud to record-test.
