## Why Time Freezing? ‚ùÑÔ∏è

While making tests, **time-sensitive objects like JWT tokens are a challenge** as they expire, leading to test failures. This increases the maintenance effort of test suites and also impacts reliability.

## What is Time Freezing? ‚è≥

With Keploy Cloud users will be able to **freeze/rollback the time in every test run, back to when the test case was recorded.**

This allows developers to ensure time-sensitive objects don‚Äôt expire or change, **making tests consistent and more reliable.**

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Running on Linux or Windows(WSL) üêßüíª

For native Linux, Windows(WSL) environments, simply **add the `--freezeTime` flag** when running your tests, like so:

```bash
keploy test -c "<appCmd>" --freezeTime
```

Voila! Your tests will now run with time freezing enabled.

### Running on Docker üê≥

For Docker-based applications, you'll need to make a few adjustments to your Dockerfile to utilize this feature:

1. First, check your system architecture

```sh
uname -a
```

2. Download the the appropriate time freeze agent for your architecture & set the `LD_PRELOAD` Environment Variable in your Dockerfile

### For Golang(Go) Applications -

#### amd64/x86_64 üñ•Ô∏è

```Dockerfile
# Download the time freeze agent
ADD https://keploy-enterprise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/assets/go_freeze_time_amd64 /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_amd64

#set suitable permissions
RUN chmod +x /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_amd64

# run the binary
RUN /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_amd64
```

OR

#### arm64/aarch64 üì±

```Dockerfile
# Download the time freeze agent

ADD https://keploy-enterprise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/assets/go_freeze_time_arm64 /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_arm64

#set suitable permissions
RUN chmod +x /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_arm64

# run the binary
RUN /lib/keploy/go_freeze_time_arm64
```

3. Add a `faketime` tag to your build script

```bash
go build -tags=faketime <your_main_file>
```

4. Re-Build your Docker image.
5. Now **add the `--freeze-time` flag** when running your tests with Keploy, like so:

```bash
keploy test -c "<appCmd>" --freeze-time
```

Voila! Your tests will now run with time freezing enabled.

### For Node/Java/Python Applications -

#### amd64/x86_64 üñ•Ô∏è

```Dockerfile
# Download the time freeze agent
ADD https://keploy-enterprise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/assets/freeze_time_amd64.so /lib/keploy/freeze_time_amd64.so

#set suitable permissions
RUN chmod +x /lib/keploy/freeze_time_amd64.so

# Set LD_PRELOAD environment variable to use freeze_time_amd64.so
ENV LD_PRELOAD=/lib/keploy/freeze_time_amd64.so
```

OR

#### arm64/aarch64 üì±

```Dockerfile
# Download the time freeze agent
ADD https://keploy-enterprise.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/releases/latest/assets/freeze_time_arm64.so /lib/keploy/freeze_time_arm64.so

#set suitable permissions
RUN chmod +x /lib/keploy/freeze_time_arm64.so

# Set LD_PRELOAD environment variable to use freeze_time_arm64.so
ENV LD_PRELOAD=/lib/keploy/freeze_time_arm64.so
```

3. Re-Build your Docker image.
4. Now **add the `--freeze-time` flag** when running your tests with Keploy, like so:

```bash
keploy test -c "<appCmd>" --freeze-time
```

Voila! Your tests will now run with time freezing enabled.
