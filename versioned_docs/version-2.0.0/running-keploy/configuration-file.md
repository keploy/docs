## Introduction

Tired of specifying the same container name, app command, or delay, filters for each record or test command? ðŸ˜´

Introducing **Keploy-config** ðŸŽ‰

It is a YAML-based file that will allow you to define the testing configurations, including container setups, delays, and any other relevant parameters.

## Getting Started: 

To generate a keploy-config file, run:

```bash
keploy generate-config --path "/path/to/your/project"
```

After successful execution of the command, a default initialized config file named as `keploy-config.yaml` has been created with the content as shown below:

```bash
record:
    path: ""
    # mandatory
    command: ""
    proxyport: 0
    containerName: ""
    networkName: ""
    delay: 5
    buildDelay: 30s
    tests:
        filters:
            - path: ""
              urlMethods: []
              headers: {}
              host: ""
    stubs:
        filters:
            - path: ""
              host: "reqres.in"
              port: 0
test:
    path: ""
    # mandatory
    command: ""
    proxyport: 0
    containerName: ""
    networkName: ""
    # example: "test-set-1": ["test-1", "test-2", "test-3"]
    selectedTests:
    # to use globalNoise, please follow the guide at the end of this file.
    globalNoise:
        global:
            body: {}
            header: {}
    delay: 5
    buildDelay: 30s
    apiTimeout: 5
    tests:
        filters:
            - path: ""
              urlMethods: []
              headers: {}
              host: ""
    stubs:
        filters:
            - path: ""
              host: "reqres.in"
              port: 0
    withCoverage: false
    coverageReportPath: ""
```

## Using the Config File

The Keploy-config file eliminates the need to repeatedly specify parameters for each record or test command. The parameters in the file correspond to the flags in the Keploy [CLI Command Docs](http://keploy.io/docs/running-keploy/cli-commands/). To run a record or test command, use:

### Record Command:

```bash
keploy record
```

### Test Command:

```bash
keploy test
```

Visit the [CLI Command Docs](http://keploy.io/docs/running-keploy/cli-commands/) to know more about the flags/parameters and their usage.

## Configuration Sections

### Record Section

The `record` section in the Keploy-config file allows you to define parameters for recording API calls.

- **`path`**: Path to the project where recording occurs. (Mandatory field)

- **`command`**: Command executed during recording.

- **`proxyport`**: Port number for the proxy. Default is 0.

- **`containerName`**: Name of the container during recording.

- **`networkName`**: Network name for the container during recording.

- **`delay`**: Delay in seconds before recording each request. Default is 5 seconds.

- **`passThroughPorts`**: Ports passed through during recording.

- **`tests`**: Filters for recorded tests.

  Example: 

    ```yaml
  tests:
    filters:
      - path: ""
        urlMethods: []
        headers: {}
        host: ""
    ```
- **`stubs`**: Filters for recorded stubs.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  stubs:
    filters:
      - path: ""
        host: "reqres.in"
        port: 0
  ```
  
### Test Section

The `test` section in the Keploy-config file allows you to define parameters for testing API calls.

- **`path`**: Path to the project where testing occurs. (Mandatory field)

- **`command`**: Command executed during testing.

- **`proxyport`**: Port number for the proxy during testing. Default is 0.

- **`containerName`**: Name of the container during testing.

- **`networkName`**: Network name for the container during testing.

- **`selectedTests`**: : Selected tests to run.
  Example:

  ```yaml
  selectedTests:
    "test-set-1": ["test-1", "test-2"]
    "test-set-2": []
  ```
- **`globalNoise`**: Noisy fields to be ignored at global/test-set level. 
  Example:

  ```yml
  globalNoise:
  global:
    body: {"url": ["https?://\S+"]}
  test-sets: {}
  ```
- **`delay`**: Delay in seconds before testing each request. Default is 5 seconds.

- **`apiTimeout`**: Timeout in seconds for API calls during testing. Default is 5 seconds.

- **`tests`**: Filters for tests.
  Example:
  ```
  tests:
  filters:
    - path: ""
      urlMethods: []
      headers: {}
      host: ""
  ```
- **`stubs`**: Filters for stubs.

  ```
  stubs:
  filters:
    - path: ""
      host: "reqres.in"
      port: 0
  ```

- **`passThroughPorts`**: Ports passed through during testing.
  Example: `passThroughPorts: [8080, 9000]`

- **`withCoverage`**: Whether to generate coverage reports during testing. Default is `false`.

- **`coverageReportPath`**: Path to store the coverage report.
  Example:
  ```yaml
  coverageReportPath: "/path/to/coverage/report"
  ```

## Advanced Noise Filtering:

Earlier the only way to add the [noisy fields](http://keploy.io/docs/concepts/general-glossary/#3-noisy-field) was by modifying individual test file (testcase level). Now, With the introduction of config file, users can add the noisy fields at test-set and global level through config file itself.

### Global Noise

The Global Noise section is used to define parameters that are globally ignored for all API calls during testing. It enables you to filter out consistent noise, ensuring a cleaner evaluation of responses.

```yml
globalNoise:
  global:
    body: 
      # To ignore some values for a field, pass regex patterns to the corresponding array value
      "url": ["https?://\S+", "http://\S+"]
    header: 
      # To ignore the entire field, pass an empty array
      "Date": []
  test-sets:
```

1. **`global`**:
  - **`body`**: Defines patterns to ignore for the request or response body, such as filtering out URLs. Example: `{"url": ["https?://\S+", "http://\S+"]}`
  - **`header`**: Specifies headers or header values to be ignored globally. Example: `{"Date": []}`

2. **`test-sets`**: This section is left empty in the example. It allows you to specify additional noise parameters for specific test sets, offering tailored noise filtering for different testing scenarios.

### Test-Set Noise

Under the `test-sets` subsection of `globalNoise`, you can define noise parameters specific to a particular test set. This ensures that certain noise is only ignored for the API calls associated with that specific test set.

```yml
test-set-1:
  body: 
    # Ignore all the values for the "url" field
    "uuid": ["b464d6df-d28b-4d12-8af1-0e2d61289578"]
  header: 
    # Pass the exact value to ignore for a field
    "User-Agent": ["PostmanRuntime/7.34.0"]

```

**`test-set-1`**:
  - **`body`**: Defines patterns to ignore for the request or response body within the specified test set. Example: `{"uuid": ["b464d6df-d28b-4d12-8af1-0e2d61289578"]}`
  - **`header`**: Specifies headers or header values to be ignored for the specified test set. Example: `{"User-Agent": ["PostmanRuntime/7.34.0"]}`

#### **Note**:
The `globalNoise` and `test-sets` are optional fields in the config file. If not specified, the default value for both fields is an empty object `{}`. This flexibility allows you to seamlessly integrate advanced noise filtering based on your testing requirements.
