Keploy's Unit Test Generator (UTG) simplifies testing by generating high-quality, maintainable unit tests with minimal manual effort. Inspired by Meta‚Äôs LLM research, it uses code semantics and Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce meaningful test cases.

To fit into modern development workflows, Keploy now supports multiple methods for unit test generation - ranging from automated pull request comments to a one-click VS Code extension and a flexible CLI tool.

Keploy's UTG aims to:

- **Automate unit test generation:** Reduce manual effort by generating tests automatically.
- **Improve edge case coverage:** Catch complex scenarios often missed manually.
- **Boost test coverage:** Make comprehensive coverage achievable as your codebase grows.

### You can try the Unit Test Generator in three ways:

1. **UTG PR Agent**: Install a GitHub App on your repo to automatically generate tests when you create a pull request.
2. **Keploy UTG VS Code Extension**: Generate test files with a single click directly from your IDE.
3. **Keploy CLI**: Use commands to manually generate unit tests for individual files or the entire project.

# Three tools to Generate Unit Tests

## 1. Keploy PR Agent - Effortless Unit Testing for Every Change üì¶

Writing and maintaining unit tests for every small code change can be a time-consuming and repetitive task. In fast-paced development environments, ensuring thorough test coverage often takes a backseat. That‚Äôs where the **Keploy PR Agent** steps in.

The **PR Agent** automates unit test generation directly from your pull requests‚Äîno manual intervention required. It understands your code changes, generates high-quality tests, and comments them directly on your PR with a single click. No more switching contexts or copy-pasting boilerplate code‚ÄîKeploy handles it all.

### How It Works - Step-by-Step Setup Guide üîß

Follow the steps below to get started with the Keploy PR Agent on your GitHub repository:

### 1. Install the Keploy GitHub App üß©

- Visit [github.com/apps/keploy](https://github.com/apps/keploy)
- Click on **"Install/Configure"**.
- Choose:
  - A **specific repository** where you want to enable the PR agent, or
  - **All repositories** if you want the functionality across your GitHub organization.
- Authorize the app to complete the installation.

### 2. Make a Code Change and Open a Pull Request üîÅ

Once the app is installed:

- Make any code changes in your repository.
- Push your changes and **create a pull request (PR)** as usual.
- The **Keploy PR Agent** will automatically detect the changes and leave a comment on the PR.

### 3. Trigger Unit Test Generation ‚ö°

In the PR comment left by Keploy:

- Click on the link (e.g., `https://api.keploy.io/github/trigger/...`).
- You will be redirected to the Keploy service, where the unit test generation process begins.
- The PR Agent uses code semantics and the power of LLMs to understand your code changes and generate meaningful unit tests.

### 4. View the Generated Tests and Summary ‚úÖ

Once the process is complete:

- Click **"Go back to the PR"**.
- The PR comment will be updated with:
  - All the **unit test files** generated for your recent changes.
  - A **test summary** presented in a **clean tabular format** showing:
    - File names
    - Number of test cases
    - Coverage details
    - Edge cases handled (if any)

You can review, modify, or directly merge the PR with complete confidence that your changes are well-tested.
With Keploy PR Agent, testing is no longer a bottleneck - it‚Äôs built right into your workflow.

## 2. VS Code Extension üîå

Generate unit tests with a single click directly from your IDE.

**Setup:**

- Go to VS Code Extensions marketplace
- Search for "Keploy" and install the extension

**Usage:**

- Open your project in VS Code
- Click on "Generate Unit Tests" button in the Keploy extension
- All test files and test cases are generated instantly for your entire project
- Tests are created with comprehensive coverage for your codebase

## 3. Command Line Interface üíª

The traditional method using Keploy CLI commands for automated test generation.

**Prerequisites:**
`API KEY` of the AI model is needed, this can be from either of one these:

- **OpenAI's [GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com/) [preferred].**
- Alternative LLMs via [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-proxy---cli).
- [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/ai-services/openai-service) Services

Now, let's setup the `API_KEY` as environment variable:

```bash
export API_KEY=xxxx
```

**Usage:**

```bash
keploy gen [flag]
```

## Command Line Usage Guide

### Running with Javascript/TypeScript applications

For the we need to make sure that the coverage report is in coberuta format, so to make sure let's modify our `package.json` by adding:

```json
"jest": {
"coverageReporters": ["text", "cobertura"],
    }
```

or if `jest.config.js` is present then, we need to add:

```js
module.exports = {
  coverageReporters: ["text", "cobertura"],
};
```

#### Generating Unit Tests

You can test a smaller section of application or to control costs, we can consider generating tests for a single source and its corresponding test file:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="<path to source file>" \
    --test-file-path="<path to test file for above source file>" \
--test-command="npm test" \
    --coverage-report-path="<path to coverage.xml>"
```

For Entire Application we can generate tests by using `--test-dir` instead of `--test-file-path`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Executing command with `--test-dir` will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

#### Example

Let us consider the [express-mongoose](https://github.com/keploy/samples-typescript/tree/main/express-mongoose) sample-application, where we have a jest testcases under `test` folder with name `routes.test.js`.

We have modified our `package.json` by adding below:

```json
"jest": {
"collectCoverage": true,
"coverageReporters": ["text", "cobertura"],
"coverageDirectory": "./coverage"
  }
```

Now let's run Keploy UTG command:

```bash
keploy gen \
  --source-file-path="./src/routes/routes.js" \
--test-file-path="./test/routes.test.js" \
  --test-command="npm test" \
--coverage-report-path="./coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml"
```

We will get following output:

<img src="/docs/img/express-mongoose-utg.png" alt="Keploy test coverage with ai generated unit tests for express-mongoose" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }}/>

_Voila!! The Generated Testcases have provided with 58% coverageüåü_

### Running with Golang applications

To ensure Cobertura formatted coverage reports, we need to install the following:

```bash
go install github.com/axw/gocov/gocov@v1.1.0
go install github.com/AlekSi/gocov-xml@v1.1.0
```

#### Generating Unit Tests

With the above dependecies installed, we can now generate tests for our application by the following dommand:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="<path to source file>o" \
  --test-file-path="<path to test file for above source file>" \
--test-command="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --coverage-report-path="<path to coverage.xml>"
```

For Entire Application we can generate tests by using `--test-dir` instead of `--test-file-path`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Executing command with `--test-dir` will generate unit tests for all files in the application. Depending on the size of the codebase, this process may take between 20 minutes to an hour and will incur costs related to LLM usage.

#### Example

Let us consider the [mux-sql](https://github.com/keploy/samples-go/tree/main/mux-sql/) sample-application, where we already have our `app_test.go` test file for `app.go` source file:

```bash
keploy gen --source-file-path="app.go" \
  --test-file-path="app_test.go" \
--test-command="go test -v ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out && gocov convert coverage.out | gocov-xml > coverage.xml" \
  --coverage-report-path="./coverage.xml"
```

We will get following output:

<img src="/docs/img/mux-sql-utg.png" alt="Keploy test coverage with ai generated unit test for mux-sql" width="100%" style={{ borderRadius: '5px' }}/>

_Voila!! The Generated Testcases have provided with 71% coverage in just 2 iterations üåü_
