Keploy's Unit Test Generator (UTG) simplifies testing by generating high-quality, maintainable unit tests with minimal manual effort. Inspired by Metaâ€™s LLM research, it uses code semantics and Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce meaningful test cases.

To fit into modern development workflows, Keploy now supports multiple methods for unit test generation - ranging from automated pull request comments to a one-click VS Code extension

Keploy's UTG aims to:

- **Automate unit test generation:** Reduce manual effort by generating tests automatically.
- **Improve edge case coverage:** Catch complex scenarios often missed manually.
- **Boost test coverage:** Make comprehensive coverage achievable as your codebase grows.

### Try the Unit Test Generator in two ways:

1. **PR Agent**: Install a GitHub App on your repo to automatically generate tests when you create a pull request.

2. **VS Code Extension**: Generate test files with a single click directly from your IDE.
