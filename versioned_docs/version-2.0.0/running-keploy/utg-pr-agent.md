> **Transform your code review process with intelligent, automated unit test generation that ensures every PR is backed by comprehensive test coverage.**

Keploy's **PR Agent** is a revolutionary GitHub App that seamlessly integrates into your pull request workflow, automatically generating high-quality unit tests for every code change. By embedding intelligent test generation directly into your GitHub PRs, this tool eliminates manual testing overhead and ensures that quality code and comprehensive tests go hand in hand **before anything reaches production**.

## **Quick Setup Guide**

Follow the steps below to get started with the Keploy PR Agent on your GitHub repository:

### Step 1. Install the Keploy GitHub App

- Visit [github.com/apps/keploy](https://github.com/apps/keploy)
- Click on **"Install/Configure"**.
  <!-- the configuration/installation screenshot goes here -->

- Choose:
  - A **specific repository** where you want to enable the PR agent, or
  - **All repositories** if you want the functionality across your GitHub organization.
- Authorize the app to complete the installation.

### Step 2. Make a Code Change and Open a Pull Request

Once the app is installed:

- Make any code changes in your repository.
- Push your changes and **create a pull request (PR)** as usual.
- The **Keploy PR Agent** will automatically detect the changes and leave a comment on the PR.

### Step 3. Trigger Unit Test Generation

In the PR comment left by Keploy:

- Click on the link (e.g., `https://api.keploy.io/github/trigger/...`).
- You will be redirected to the Keploy service, where the unit test generation process begins.
- The PR Agent uses code semantics and the power of LLMs to understand your code changes and generate meaningful unit tests.

### Step 4. View the Generated Tests and Summary

Once the process is complete:

- Click **"Go back to the PR"**.
- The PR comment will be updated with:
  - All the **unit test files** generated for your recent changes.
  - A **test summary** presented in a **clean tabular format** showing: - File names - Number of test cases - Coverage details - Edge cases handled (if any)
    <!-- one image with the tabular format comment with the test summary will be added here -->

    You can review, modify, or directly merge the PR with complete confidence that your changes are well-tested.
    With Keploy PR Agent, testing is no longer a bottleneck - itâ€™s built right into your workflow.
