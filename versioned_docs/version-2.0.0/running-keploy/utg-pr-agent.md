### Step 4. View the Generated Tests and Summary

Once the process is complete:

- Click **"Go back to the PR"**.
- The PR comment will be updated with:
  - All the **unit test files** generated for your recent changes.
  - A **test summary** presented in a **clean tabular format** showing: - File names - Number of test cases - Coverage details - Edge cases handled (if any)
    <!-- one image with the tabular format comment with the test summary will be added here -->
