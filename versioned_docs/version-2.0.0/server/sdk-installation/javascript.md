|      javascript      | [nyc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyc) |

## Usage

### Update package file

Update the `package.json` file that runs the application:

```json
  "scripts": {
    //other scripts
    "test": "jest --coverage --collectCoverageFrom='src/**/*.{js,jsx}'",
    "coverage:merge": "mkdir -p ./coverage && nyc merge ./coverage .nyc_output/out.json",
    "coverage:report": "nyc report --reporter=lcov --reporter=text",
    //other scripts
  }
```

In test script, --coverage flag would trigger the report generation for jest. For report generation in other testing frameworks like mocha, intern, tap, refer https://istanbul.js.org/docs/tutorials/

To generate coverage report for your unit tests, Run:

```bash
npm test
```

To merge coverage data of unit tests with keploy tests, Run:

```bash
npm run coverage:merge
```

To get coverage related information for merged coverage data, Run:

```bash
npm run coverage:report
```
