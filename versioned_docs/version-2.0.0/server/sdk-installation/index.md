To get the coverage report, first make sure all the requirements are met and then run Keploy test as usual with your application command:

```bash
keploy test -c "your_application_command"
```

After successful execution of this command, A coverage report would be generated inside the test-run folder of keploy/reports.

```sh
keploy
├── reports
│   └── test-run-0
│       ├── coverage.yaml
│       └── test-set-0-report.yaml
└── test-set-0
    ├── mocks.yaml
    └── tests
        ├── test-1.yaml
        └── test-2.yaml
```

**Note**: In case of java application, before running test subcommand, you need to clean the project by removing any previously generated file, and run install command.

```bash
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

## Graceful Shutdown

It is important that the application is shutdown gracefully. In case of Golang, function for graceful shutdown:

```go
func GracefulShutdown() {
	stopper := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	// listens for interrupt and SIGTERM signal
	signal.Notify(stopper, os.Interrupt, os.Kill, syscall.SIGKILL, syscall.SIGTERM)
	go func() {
		select {
		case <-stopper:
			os.Exit(0)
		}
	}()
}

func main() {

	port := "8080"

	r := gin.Default()

	r.GET("/:param", getURL)
	r.POST("/url", putURL)
	// should be called before starting the API server from main()
	GracefulShutdown()

	r.Run()
}
```
