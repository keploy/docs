Keploy can be installed in two ways:

1. [One-Click Install](#one-click-install-keploy).
2. [Manual Install](#manual-install)

## One click install Keploy.

<CodeBlock>curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keploy/keploy/main/keploy.sh && source keploy.sh</CodeBlock>

## Manual Install

There are two ways to use Keploy eBPF in windows, you can use either use:

1. [Natively in Windows](#windows-native) using WSL.
2. By [Using Docker](#using-docker).

## Windows Native

### Download the Keploy Binary

On Windows, WSL is required to run Keploy Binary. You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below.

<CodeBlock language="zsh">wsl --install</CodeBlock>

This command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and install the Ubuntu distribution of Linux. (This default distribution can be changed).

If you're running an older build, or just prefer not to use the install command and would like step-by-step directions, see WSL manual installation steps for older versions.

Once installed download and Install "Keploy Binary" :

<CodeBlock language="zsh">curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_amd64.tar.gz" | tar xz -C /tmp && sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin && keploy</CodeBlock>

#### Run the Record Mode

Run this command on your terminal to start the recording of API calls:-

<CodeBlock language="shell">sudo -E keploy record -c "path/to/the/application/binary"</CodeBlock>

Make API Calls using [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or cURL command.

Keploy with capture the API calls you have made to generate the test-suites which will contain the testcases and data mocks into `YAML` format.

#### Run the Test Mode

Run this command on your terminal to run the testcases and generate the test coverage report:-

<CodeBlock language="shell">sudo -E keploy test -c "path/to/the/application/binary" --delay 10</CodeBlock>

Voilà! 🧑🏻‍💻 We have the server running!

## Using Docker

### Creating Alias

We need to create a custom network for Keploy since we are using the Docker, therefore application container would require `docker network` to act as the bridge between them.

If you're using a **docker-compose network**, replace `keploy-network` with your app's `docker_compose_network_name` below.

<CodeBlock language="zsh">docker network create keploy-network</CodeBlock>

Once the Custom Network is created, now we have to create the alias for the Keploy.

<CodeBlock language="shell">alias keploy='sudo docker run --pull always --name keploy-v2 -p 16789:16789 --privileged --pid=host -it -v "$(pwd)":/files -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup -v /sys/kernel/debug:/sys/kernel/debug -v /sys/fs/bpf:/sys/fs/bpf -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock --rm ghcr.io/keploy/keploy'</CodeBlock>

#### Run the Record Mode

Now, we will use the newly created Alias `keploy` to record the testcases.

```shell
keploy record -c "docker run -p <appPort>:<hostPort> --name <containerName> --network keploy-network --rm <applicationImage>" --containerName "<containerName>" --delay 10
```

#### Run the Test Mode

Now, we will use the newly created Alias `keploy` to test the testcases.

```shell
keploy test -c "docker run -p <appPort>:<hostPort> --name <containerName> --network keploy-network --rm <applicationImage>" --containerName "<containerName>" --delay 20
```

> **CMD_to_run_user_container** is the docker command to run the application.
> If you are using `docker compose` command to start the application, `--containerName` is required.

Voilà! 🧑🏻‍💻 We have the server running!

You'll be able to see the test-cases that ran with the results report on the console as well locally in the `testReport` directory.

**Footnote**

1. `delay` is required while using Test Mode.
2. containerName is optional if you are using `Docker run` command, as the Container name must be present within the command itself.
