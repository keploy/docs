# Running Keploy Natively on MacOS by setting up a linux env

**_Downloading and running Keploy in Native using Debian on MacOS_**

1. Open the terminal Session.
2. Run the following command. This installs homebrew and makes it easier to manage software and packages on macOS

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Now, with the help of homebrew, we would install Lima (Linux Virtual Machine) by running this command.

   ```bash
   brew install lima
   ```

4. Create a Debian instance.

   ```bash
   limactl create template://debian-12
   ```

5. Start the instance

   ```bash
   limactl start debian-12
   ```

6. Enter the shell of the running linux instance

   ```bash
   limactl shell debian-12
   ```

7. Now you are in the linux shell of the debian instance. Replace `{Username}` with your actual macOS username in the following command. This will take you directly to your macOS home directory. (You might need to allow access to Terminal.app in a popup)

   ```bash
   cd /Users/{Username}
   ```

8. Run the following command to install Keploy

   ```bash
   curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_arm64.tar.gz" | tar xz --overwrite -C /tmp
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin/keploy
   ```

Congratulations! You've successfully set up Keploy natively on MacOS.
