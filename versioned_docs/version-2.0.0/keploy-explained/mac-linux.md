# Running Keploy Natively on MacOS by setting up a linux env

### Downloading and running Keploy in Native using Debian on MacOS

1. Open the terminal Session.
2. Run the following command. This installs homebrew and makes it easier to manage software and packages on macOS

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

3. Now, with the help of homebrew, we would install Lima (Linux Virtual Machine) by running this command.

```bash
brew install lima
```

4. Paste this command next.

```bash
limactl show-ssh --format=config debian-12 & add it to its ssh config
```

5. Open a remote window on your code editor
6. Click on connect to host
7. Now select the configured SSH as "lima-debian"
8. Once you are in the terminal run the following commands to go into your directory

```bash
cd /Users
```

```bash
cd /{Username}
```

9. Run the following command to install Keploy

```bash
curl --silent --location "https://github.com/keploy/keploy/releases/latest/download/keploy_linux_arm64.tar.gz" | tar xz --overwrite -C /tmp
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin && sudo mv /tmp/keploy /usr/local/bin/keploy
```

10. Run the following command to install Zsh

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install zsh
```

**Why?** : zsh (Z Shell) is an advanced shell that offers enhanced features compared to the default bash shell. It provides better autocompletion, advanced globbing, improved history management, and more customization options.

11. Install Git

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install git
```

12. Install 'Oh-my-zsh'

```bash
sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
```

**Why?** : oh-my-zsh is a framework for managing your zsh configuration. It comes with a collection of plugins, themes, and helpful features that enhance the zsh experience.

13. Commands to Install docker

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install ca-certificates curl
```

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
```

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

```bash
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

14. Add docker to sudoers

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

```bash
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
```
