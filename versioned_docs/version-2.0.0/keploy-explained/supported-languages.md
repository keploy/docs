# 🌍 Supported Languages for Unit Testing

Keploy is a vertical AI testing agent—built to deliver real, valuable tests (not just code snippets!) for your codebase.

Here’s where we are today, and what makes us different:

## ✅ Currently Supported

**Go (Golang):** Our most mature integration.

Keploy generates _and runs_ AI-powered unit tests for your Go projects.

**Only the tests that actually increase code coverage and pass reliably are kept anything else is filtered out.**

## 🚀 Coming Soon

**Java:**  
 Java support is on the way!

We’ll bring the same AI-driven, high-quality test generation and validation workflow to Java soon.

## 🧩 Why Only a Few Languages (for now)?

**We don’t just create test code—we validate every AI-generated test:**

- Each test is executed against your actual codebase.
- If a test builds, runs, and increases coverage, it’s included.
- If it doesn’t add value, it’s automatically discarded.

This rigorous, quality-first approach means we focus on fewer languages, but deliver _real_, _useful_ tests—not noisy, irrelevant code.

## 💬 Want More Languages?

We’re expanding—tell us what language you need next!

**Our Promise:**  
No matter the language, Keploy helps you create _meaningful_, _maintainable_ tests that genuinely improve your code—not just sample outputs.
