Let's check some of the common errors that you might encounter while working with Keploy!

### 1. Dependency Not Found Error

#### Description:

This error occurs when Keploy cannot locate or access a required dependency, such as a database or external service.

#### Possible Cause:

- The dependency may not be running or is incorrectly configured.
- Networking issues may be preventing Keploy from connecting to external dependencies.

#### Solution:

- Verify that all required services (e.g., databases, third-party APIs) are active and accessible.
- Check the environment variables or configuration files to confirm the correct host and port details.
- Use network diagnostic tools (e.g., ping, traceroute) to identify connectivity issues.

### 2. Unable to Record API Calls

#### Description:

Keploy fails to record incoming API traffic, meaning no tests are generated.

#### Possible Cause:

- Incorrect integration with the application.
- Keploy may not be correctly started with the application, or the SDK is not configured properly.
- The application may not be making API calls that are recognizable by Keploy.

#### Solution:

- Double-check the integration guide for the programming language you’re using.
- Ensure that Keploy is properly hooked into the API layer.
- Check Keploy logs for any missed or skipped requests.

### 3. Test Replay Failure

#### Description:

Keploy is unable to replay recorded API requests.

#### Possible Cause:

- External services or databases may be in a different state than they were during recording.
- Non-deterministic values like timestamps, UUIDs, or random values are causing failures.

#### Solution:

- Leverage Keploy’s mocking capabilities to simulate external services and databases.
- Use configurations to handle or exclude non-deterministic values for consistent comparisons.
- Regularly reset the database state to match the conditions during recording.

### 4. Response Mismatch Error

#### Description:

When Keploy replays API calls, it detects a mismatch between the recorded response and the current response.

#### Possible Cause:

- The application’s behavior has changed, leading to different responses.
- Changes in the response format, status codes, or headers that weren’t present during recording.

#### Solution:

- Review the application changes and determine if the mismatch is expected (e.g., new features).
- If the change is acceptable, update the test baseline to reflect the new behavior.
- Use Keploy’s flexible comparison options to ignore certain fields or values (like timestamps or version numbers).

### 5. Incorrect Test Generation

#### Description:

Keploy generates tests that don’t properly reflect the API interactions.

#### Possible Cause:

- The API interaction may be too complex or involve custom logic that Keploy cannot automatically handle.
- API parameters may be missing or misinterpreted during recording.

#### Solution:

- Review the recorded test cases for correctness.
- Manually adjust the generated tests to include missing or misinterpreted parameters.
- Make use of Keploy’s API to refine the recording process if necessary.

### 6. Database Connection Error during Test Replay

#### Description:

Keploy cannot connect to the database or other external systems during the replay of tests.

#### Possible Cause:

- The test environment may not have access to the same database as the original recording.
- Database credentials or host information could be incorrect or missing in the test environment.

#### Solution:

- Mirror the test environment configuration with the recording setup.
- Use database mocks or stubs for isolated testing.
- Double-check connection strings, credentials, and database availability.

### 7. Missing or Invalid Configuration Error

#### Description:

Keploy cannot find a valid configuration file or encounters errors in the configuration.

#### Possible Cause:

- The Keploy configuration file (keploy.yaml or similar) is missing or contains invalid values.
- Environment variables required by Keploy may not be set.

#### Solution:

- Ensure the configuration file exists and follows the correct format.
- Populate all required fields with valid values.
- Check that environment variables are properly set.

### 8. Timeout Errors

#### Description:

Keploy times out while recording or replaying API calls.

#### Possible Cause:

- Long-running API requests or slow external dependencies can cause timeout issues.
- Keploy may have low timeout settings for API calls.

#### Solution:

- Increase timeout settings in the Keploy configuration.
- Identify and optimize slow-performing APIs or dependencies.
- Use monitoring tools to analyze API performance.

### 9. Insufficient Permissions

#### Description:

Keploy fails due to insufficient permissions when accessing files, networks, or other resources.

#### Possible Cause:

The user or service running Keploy may not have sufficient permissions to access resources like databases, APIs, or file systems.

#### Solution:

- Ensure that the user or service running Keploy has the necessary permissions.
- Review system permissions and provide the required access rights for Keploy to function properly.

### 10. Version Compatibility Issues

#### Description:

Errors occur because of version mismatches between Keploy, its dependencies, or the application it’s testing.

#### Possible Cause:

- Using incompatible versions of Keploy or related SDKs with your application.
- Dependencies of Keploy (e.g., for mocking or replaying) may have updated and broken compatibility.

#### Solution:

- Verify version compatibility for Keploy and its SDKs.
- Consult Keploy documentation or release notes for known issues.
- Use version pinning to maintain a stable environment.

### 11. Unsupported Protocol or API

#### Description:

Keploy does not support the protocol or API structure you are using (e.g., gRPC, SOAP, etc.).

#### Possible Cause:

- The application might use an API or protocol that Keploy doesn’t yet support (e.g., WebSocket, gRPC).

#### Solution:

- Confirm the supported protocols (currently HTTP/REST and GraphQL).
- Consider alternative tools or frameworks for unsupported protocols.
