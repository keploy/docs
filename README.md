## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

We use a variety of technologies to build the web interface and support the community:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)

We use NodeJS and Yarn to install, test, and build the website. Docusaurus serves as our static site generator. React powers our component-based UI, and GitHub Actions manages CI/CD pipelines.

---

## üß© Installation

The Keploy documentation site uses **Docusaurus 2**.

To get started locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start


The command starts a local development server and opens a browser window.

> üí° **Tip:** After running `npm install`, use `npm start` to preview changes live at `http://localhost:3000/`.


## Running Vale Locally for Documentation Linting

To help maintain consistency in our documentation, we use Vale, a syntax-aware linter that checks for spelling, grammar, and style issues.

### Installation

**Step 1: Install Vale**

If you're on macOS, you can install Vale using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install vale
```

Alternatively, you can install Vale manually:

1. Download Vale: Visit the Vale Releases page and download the latest version for your operating system.

2. Install Vale:

- On macOS and Linux, extract the binary, move it to /usr/local/bin, and make it executable:

```bash
sudo mv vale /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vale
```

- On Windows, follow the instructions in the downloaded .zip file.

**Step 2: Configure Vale**

1. Ensure you have the .vale.ini configuration file in the root directory.

2. Check that StylesPath in .vale.ini points to the vale_styles directory (where custom styles are stored):

```ini
StylesPath = vale_styles
MinAlertLevel = error
```

### Running Vale

1. Linting Documentation: To check all markdown files in versioned_docs/version-2.0.0/ for errors, run:

```bash
vale versioned_docs/version-2.0.0/**/*.md
```

2. Review Errors:

- Vale will output any issues directly in the terminal. Address these issues in the markdown files to maintain style consistency.

Note: Running Vale locally helps catch issues early, ensuring a smooth review process when you submit a pull request.

## Prettier

1. Fork the repository

<br/>

2. Clone the repository with the following command. Replace the {'<'}GITHUB_USERNAME{'>'} with your username

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<GITHUB_USERNAME>/docs.git

## Go into the directory containing the project

cd docs
```

<br/>

3. Install all the dependencies

```sh
npm install

## Start the development server.

npm start
```

4. To reformat:

```sh
npx prettier --write '**/*.{js,md}'
```

5. Check the build status:

```sh
npm run build
```

> Note: if the Build is failing, fix the changes before making PR.

When we merge your PR, a new build automatically occurs and your changes publish to [https://keploy.io/docs](https://keploy.io/docs).

## How to Get Involved?

Keploy welcomes contributions to the docs website. If you have an idea for a new feature or a bug fix, please submit an issue or pull request. Our planned features can be found on our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/keploy/keploy/issues/new/choose).
