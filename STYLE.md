# Style Guidance

Keploy documentation generally follows the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style).  

When the Google guide does not address a specific topic, we defer to the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

## 🛠️ Keploy-Specific Style Guidelines

The following are Keploy-specific rules that override or expand on the Google and Microsoft guides.

---

### 📌 Capitalization of Core Terms

Some of Keploy’s core terms may also exist as generic terms in software or technical contexts.  
To reduce confusion, **always capitalize Keploy-specific terms** when referring to features or platform components. Generic usage should be lowercase and used sparingly.

✅ **Correct:**  
> “Next, Normalise the Test case on the Test run details page.”

❌ **Incorrect:**  
> “Next, normalise the test case on the test run details.”

---

### 🔤 Sentence Case in Headings

Use **sentence case** for all titles and headings. This means only the **first word** and **proper nouns** are capitalized.

✅ Correct:
> How to get started with Keploy

❌ Incorrect:
> How To Get Started With Keploy

---

### 🧾 Infinitive Verb Forms in Headings

Use **infinitive verb forms** (e.g., "to install", "to create", "to configure") in titles and headings.  
This improves searchability and aligns with common SEO practices.

✅ Correct:
> Install Keploy  
> Create test cases

❌ Incorrect:
> Installing Keploy  
> Creating test cases

---

### 🧮 En Dashes in Ranges

Use **en dashes (–)** to indicate numeric ranges. Do **not** mix styles or use hyphens inconsistently.  
You may also use words like *from*, *to*, or *through* — but be consistent throughout the doc.

✅ Correct:
- 5–10 GB
- 5 to 10 GB

❌ Incorrect:
- from 5-10 GB
- 5–10 GB and 10 to 20 MB (mixed style)

---

### 🧠 Use Active Voice

Use **active voice** instead of passive voice to improve clarity and readability.

✅ Correct:
> Keploy records the API calls and generates test cases.

❌ Incorrect:
> The API calls are recorded and test cases are generated by Keploy.

---

### 🌍 Write for Global Readability

Use clear, simple, and **inclusive language**:
- Avoid jargon or unexplained acronyms.
- Provide context for technical terms.
- Prefer short, direct sentences.

✅ Better:
> After installing Go, use the following command to run Keploy.

❌ Confusing:
> Assuming GOPATH is set and your binaries are globally linked, execute Keploy.

---

### 🔧 Code Formatting

- Wrap inline code using backticks: \`like this\`
- Use triple backticks for multi-line code blocks:
    \`\`\`bash  
    npm install  
    npm run serve  
    \`\`\`
- Add comments in code examples where needed for clarity.

---

## ✅ Summary Checklist for Writers

- [ ] Are headings in sentence case and infinitive form?
- [ ] Are core terms capitalized correctly?
- [ ] Did I use active voice wherever possible?
- [ ] Are numeric ranges formatted consistently?
- [ ] Is my language clear and globally understandable?
